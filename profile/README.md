## Athena ðŸ¦‰

Athena is a modern blockchain operating system designed and built by [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io/) for running programs (a.k.a. smart contracts) in a manner that's performant, deterministic, and efficiently provable. For more information see [Introducing Athena](https://spacemesh.io/blog/introducing-athena/) and the [Athena monorepo](https://github.com/athenavm/athena).

More information and resources will appear here as they become available.
